### About my learning progress
I've taken lessons of Stata at PUCP. I became the first place of that class. Since that, I've continued learning that prograrm, applying it at work
and I've also been learning other languages. Particuarly, this semester I took the R and Python classes. It is almost finished, but i can already say 
it is being very helpful, since I am already using some of that knowledge at work. Finally, also because of work matters, I'm learning the basics of 
QGis. I'm still quite new there, but I am looking forward to learning more about it. Here is a brief summary og my learning progress:
